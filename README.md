# 2D-plane-with-keyboard-functions-using-OpenGL.
This is an OpenGL project using cpp and various functions here I drew a 2D palne and its mirrors about x axis and y axis.
so here are total 4 palnes, and the keyboard functionality are given below:
pressing 1 - selects first plane,
pressing 2- second plane,
3- 3rd plane,
4- 4th plane,
capital X- selects X axis,
capital Y- selects Y axis,
capital Z- selects Z axis,
capital T- translate,
capital I- moves up about axis,
capital J- moves forward about axis,
capital K- moves backward about axis,
capital L- moves down about axis,
capital F- flip ,
capital M- rotate about origin,
